# CodeIgniter MongoDB Library

This is an active record inspired CodeIgniter library to integrate a MongoDB database into your application.

1. Add the file Mongo_db.php to your /application/libraries folder.
2. Add the file mongodb.php to your /application/config folder.
3. Update the config file.

You can now autoload the library or include it in one of your controllers at run time.

You can interact with the database using many of the active record functions that CodeIgniter provides.

	$this->mongo_db
		->where_gte('age', 18)
		->where_in('country', array(
			'England',
			'Scotland',
			'Wales',
			'Ireland'
		))
		->where(array(
			'likes_whisky' => TRUE
		))
		->get('people');
	
The result will be an object containing matching documents.
